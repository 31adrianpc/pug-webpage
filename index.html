        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Wilson
            I am 5 years old and I am a very happy pug. I love food, especially sweet potatoes, vegetables and
            fruits. I
            also enjoy taking long naps and playing with my favorite toys. But what I like most is going to the park
            near my house to meet my friends and have a good time together. Every day is a new adventure for me!</p>

        <p>In this space, you can discover all my pranks, my favorite foods and, of course, my favorite toy that I
            never get
            tired of. I have also prepared a special gallery where
            you can see my funniest moments and the adventures I experience daily. If you like dogs and funny
            stories, you're in the right place!</p>
