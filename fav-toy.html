                    Ever since I was a puppy, I have had a very special toy: my green ball. It has been with me since I
                    was
                    tiny and has grown up with me.
                    I love to run after the ball when my owner throws it to me, although sometimes I make it harder to
                    catch
                    it just to keep us playing longer.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, when I am very tired after playing, I just take it with me and lie down next to it. It's
                    like
                    a faithful friend who is always ready for another round of play.
                </p>
